# Sorry, folks. This Programming language is gone.
As it has turned out, this language is not exactly turning out how I wanted. It was deaveating more-and-more to another Java clone. Unfortunatly, some other concerns came up:
    * The parser was not extensible enough
    * The language was far to slow
    * Ugly syntax
    * No macros
    * Not functional enough
    * And many other little problems
I have now moved on to implementing a little language called Alonzo, which is based on lamda calculus, scheme, and haskell. I am implementing it in rust using a port of douglas crockford's top down operator precidance parser.
