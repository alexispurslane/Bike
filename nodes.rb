# The first type is responsible for holding a collection of nodes,
# each one representing an expression. You can think of it as the internal
# representation of a block of code.
#
# Here we define nodes as Ruby classes that inherit from a Struct. This is a
# simple way, in Ruby, to create a class that holds some attributes (values).
# It is almost equivalent to:
# 
#     class Nodes
#       def initialize(nodes)
#         @nodes = nodes
#       end
#
#       def nodes
#         @nodes
#       end
#     end
#
#     n = Nodes.new("this is stored @nodes")
#     n.nodes # => "this is stored @nodes"
#
# But Ruby's Struct takes care of overriding the == operator for us and a bunch of
# other things that will make testing easier.
class Nodes < Struct.new(:nodes)
  def <<(node) # Useful method for adding a node on the fly.
    nodes << node
    self
  end
end

# Literals are static values that have a Ruby representation. For example, a string, a number, 
# true, false, nil, etc. We define a node for each one of those and store their Ruby
# representation inside their value attribute.
class LiteralNode < Struct.new(:value, :type); end

class NumberNode < LiteralNode; end

# be nodes that need to be evaluated at some point.
